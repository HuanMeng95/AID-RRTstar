# AID-RRT*
# Note
Please install "install_mpt3.m" and add "ICLOCS_1.2" to the path before running the main function.
The code is tested in MATLAB 2018b environment.

MAP = ["map1","map2","map3","map4"];
In the main function, we defined 4 maps and saved the names in an array. By selecting the corresponding map, we can get the final generated trajectory.
